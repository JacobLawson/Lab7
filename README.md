###Part B Functionality


This was completed during today at 11:00, and was uploaded later.

I just followed the example set forth from previous labs to create a simple library.Goleft, Goright, and Go center took place depending on which sensor was active. These served to go get the digital output from each sensor after it was converted from analog to digital. I ended up using pins 1.4 for left, 1.5 for right, and 1.3 for center.

###Part A Functionality

This was completed during class today at 1300, and was uploaded later.
The distance was measured in inches, left and right were measured from where the ruler met the respective wheel. Center was measured from where the ruler met the front of the protoboard closest to the sensor.
